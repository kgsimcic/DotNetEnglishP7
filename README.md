The goal is to design 7 REST APIs with unit tests, field validation (mostly for numbers and user data, since I was not given much business context for the assignment), appropriate logging, and a security layer.

Currently I have implemented the controllers, services, and repositories for the classes, but have only written unit tests for the user controller and am working on the validation component for the User Service.
